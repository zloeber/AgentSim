# AgentSim - Multi-Agent Framework Requirements

# Core dependencies (minimal for the framework)
# Note: In a real implementation with GPU inference, you would include:
# - torch>=2.0.0
# - transformers>=4.30.0
# - accelerate>=0.20.0
# or similar packages for your specific inference backend

# For testing
pytest>=7.4.0
pytest-cov>=4.1.0

# For type checking (optional but recommended)
mypy>=1.4.0
